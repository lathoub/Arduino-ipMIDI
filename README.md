# Arduino-ipMIDI

Works find on ESP32, but when run on a W5100 Ethernet shield, it stops working after a while.

Important note: this library is will not work stand alone, you will need a fork of the MIDI library installed as well!
Use the static-polymorphism branch in https://github.com/lathoub/arduino_midi_library !!

# Any help is much appreciated!
